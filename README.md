# Hangman-Game
Hangman-Game is a web app. A random word from a preset list is chosen and you must correctly guess each letter of the word. Your remaining number of guesses will go down if you guess incorrectly. If you run out of remaining guesses, the game is over and you lose. Guess the word completely to win the game!

## How To Use
1. Read the hint to get an idea of what the word is
2. Type a letter to make a guess
3. Keep typing letters until you either run out of guesses or guess the word correctly.
